# Cluedo
This game was made in a group, I received help from 2 other students, Rosanne Saparamadu and Abigail Espejo @abi6ail. I was responsible for the main class 'GameControl', where all the game logic and initialisation happens. We built this version of the game using the concept MVC (Model View Controller). The game expects you to have a basic knowledge of how Cluedo is played.
